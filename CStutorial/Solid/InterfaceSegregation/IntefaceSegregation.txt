 Interface segregation

 Interface segreagtion mean that an interface should not have to much undefined method placed inside one interface, but rather, breaking it down into a more sensible
 and seperate interfaces. 

 So what I mean is that you should not place all your methods inside one interface and forces the user to inherit method that they don't want and need.
 This makes it hard on the developer to manage all this methods.

 Basically the interface segregation principle is the interface of version of single responsibility principle that is the rule for classes, but without very strict, meaning 
 that the interface does not have to focus on one thing.

 e.g interface
 CarViolate
 ICar
 INavigation
 IOperating System

 In the CarViolate interface, i place all my methods into one place, which is violates the Interface segregation principle. But interfaces like Icar, Inavigation and
 Ioperating system are complimenting interface segregation principle, because we have seperate the methods from carviolated into different interfaces; making it managable
 for the devoper.
