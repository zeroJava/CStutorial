 
 Open close principle

 Open closed principle means that a class should be open to extensions, but closed to modification.

 What this means that when we create a class, we should never come to a situation where we have to modify the functions in the class.

 What is menat by this is, that the class and the function should be future proof; meaning that in the future if there is feature that has been added,
 then we should it able to intergrate it to currenct classes (open to extension), without the need to go into the class and modify it (close to modifaction).

 The open close principle is the continuation from the single responsibilty principle, where the class should have a single responsibilty. The open close principle
 takes of from here by saying that, when this class is made, we can never change the difition of the class; because by changing the class, we are changing its
 purpose.
