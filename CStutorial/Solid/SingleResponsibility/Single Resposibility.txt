 
 Single responsibility

 Single responsibility means that a class should be designed to do one thing and only have one responsility.

 Instead of having one big class that does evrything, let's split it up into smaller classes.

 e.g.

 classes: 
 User
 Display

 Here we have two classes: user and display. The user class will create objcets which are users of the system. Where as the display will display those users.
 Using Single Responsibilty Principle, we have given each of those class a single purpose. Combining those those two claases together will violate the principle
 because the combined class will have multiple purpose; which is, one to store the user, and the other to diplay the user.
