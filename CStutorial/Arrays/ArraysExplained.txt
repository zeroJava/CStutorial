Arrays Explained

/* An array is a linear data structure, which allows multiple variables to be placed inside a
* single variable, which the compiler/OS stores as a continous block of memory (Al Bahari, c# 7.0).
* E.g. int[] ar = new int[5] { 0, 2, 5, 3, 2}; // stored in memory
* +-----------+
* | ar[0] | 0 |
* | ar[0] | 2 |
* | ar[0] | 5 |
* | ar[0] | 3 |
* | ar[0] | 2 |
* +-----------+
* */

/* Arrays are of fixed size, meaning that once they're iniitialised, the size of the array cannot be
* changed, but the varaible can be overridden with a new array.
* 
* E.g.
* int arr = new int[5];
* arr.add(); // compiler error no function exist.
* arr = new int[6]; // This is legal.
* 
* The square bracket denotes the size of the array, I.e int arr = new int[5] means that this array will
* be able to hold 5 varaibles.
* */

/* All arrays inherit from the System.Array class. */
