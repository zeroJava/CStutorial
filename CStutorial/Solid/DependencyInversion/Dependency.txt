 Dependency Inversion principle

 High level modules should not depend upon low-level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.
 Abstractions should never depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions

 Dependency inversion principle means that components should not be depend on specific classes. Instead the components in the class should be joined through 
 abstraction. Meaning data types in varaibles and method parameters should be abstract and not specific.

 Dependency inversion principle compliments abstraction and loose coupling.

 E.g
 ICar
 Supercar
 Saloon
 Valdator

 We made our validate method deal in an abstract level, so it would not be tied to specific class, and thus making it more flexible.
